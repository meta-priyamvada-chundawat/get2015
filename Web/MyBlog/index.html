				<h3>To-Do in Hawaii -The ultimate vacation travel guide</h3>
					<p>
						When most people hear Hawaii what usually comes to mind are the beautiful beaches of Waikiki, Oahu to the oasis of Maui, 
						yet many people haven't explored the garden isle of Kauai, or the volcanic hot spot of Hawaii. 
						Oahu and Maui are only the beginning to what is ready for exploration on the beautiful islands of Kauai, and Hawaii. 
						Having been to all 4 major islands, I decided to post my favorite spots to visit and explore on each island.

						Na Pali Coast
					</figcaption>
						<p>
							This scenic area on the island's north west coast is one of the most breathtaking naturally made coast lines in the world. 
							It offers some of the most beautiful beaches. The Pali (cliffs) rise as high as 4,000 feet (1200m) above the beautiful pacific ocean.
							The coast can be enjoyed by hiking, boating and by air (either helicopter or small airplane). A definite must see!

				<h3>You also get to visit Oahu !</h3>
				<p>
					The most important piece of Oahu lies within the capital. This harbor is a definite must see for the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial/WWII Valor
					in the Pacific National Monument. Having been bombed by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, one must pay tribute to those 
					who have fallen during this disastrous day.<br/>
					Pearl Harbour also offers the U.S.S. Missouri Memorial and the National Cemetery of the Pacific, where 25,000 soldiers 
					who bravely fought in the war are at last at peace. This is surely time well spent!
